-A Yolo 4 model for discriminating between bonobo and chimpanzee faces-

While I worked in great-ape faces at the laboratory I discerned that most people that unfamiliar with these species' faces are failed to discriminate between chimpanzee and bonobo faces. "They all look to same" always I heard from participants throughout my research period. Today, I thought maybe this model may help those who trying to discriminate between bonobo and chimpanzee faces. 

I trained my model in google-collab with a free graphic card for about 6.5+ hours. I will put all weight files but be careful about the overfitting problem! I always use 3000 weights for detection, which has the %90  mean average precision (mAP@0.50 = 0.906938 -Detection Time: 4 Seconds)
